- **Simple Chatbox:** Experience the creation of a basic chatbox, demonstrating the integration of language processing capabilities.

### Additional Features:

- **Gradio Integration:** Most of the notebooks include a simple API for running on the web, built with Gradio. This allows for easy deployment and interaction with the models in a user-friendly interface.
- **Focus on Hugging Face:** This repository showcases the strength of Hugging Face and the ease of fine-tuning and running machine learning models. Explore the notebooks to witness firsthand the versatility and accessibility of Hugging Face's tools.

### How to Run:

1. **Set Up Virtual Environment:** Before running the notebooks, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. You can do so by executing the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv myenv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Once the virtual environment is activated, install all necessary dependencies by executing:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Notebooks:** With the dependencies installed, you're ready to explore the notebooks! Open them in your preferred environment and start experimenting.
